description = "Remove worktree after PR merge"

prompt = """
Remove a git worktree after the PR has been merged.

Execute the centralized script:
```bash
bash scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh {{args}}
```

The script will:
- Ensure it's running from repo root
- Remove the worktree directory
- Optionally delete the branch (non-interactive)
- Prune stale worktree registrations
- Display remaining worktrees

Optional flags:
- --force - Force removal even with uncommitted changes
- --delete-branch - Delete the feature branch (default: keep)

Report the result to the user including:
- What was removed
- Whether branch was deleted or kept
- Remaining active worktrees
