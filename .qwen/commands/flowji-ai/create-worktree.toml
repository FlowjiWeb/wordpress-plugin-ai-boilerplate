prompt = """
Create a new git worktree for parallel development with multiple AI agents.

Execute the centralized script:
```bash
bash scripts/create-worktree.sh {{args}}
```

The script will:
- Ensure it's running from repo root
- Fetch the base branch (default: origin/main)
- Create worktree in ../mpc-<feature-name>
- Create branch feature/<feature-name> based on the base branch
- Display next steps

Optional flags:
- --base <branch> - Branch from a different base (e.g., --base origin/release-1.0)

Report the result to the user including:
- Worktree directory path
- Branch name
- Base branch used
- Next steps (cd to directory, start agent)
