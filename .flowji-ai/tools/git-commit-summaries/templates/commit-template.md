<!--
GIT COMMIT TEMPLATE

PURPOSE:
This template guides AI agents to write descriptive commit messages.
The agent should provide CONTEXT and DESCRIPTIONS, not just filenames.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS:
- Write what changed and why, not just list files
- For Added files: Describe the file's purpose or content
- For Updated files: Summarize what was modified
- For Removed files: Note why it was deleted (if clear from context)
- Be concise but informative - future readers should understand what happened

GOOD EXAMPLE:
### Added
- Added config-castlemaine-2026.json with venue settings for new Castlemaine course

BAD EXAMPLE:
### Added
- config-castlemaine-2026.json

NOTE: Auto-generated sections (Files Created, Files Edited, Files Deleted) 
will be added by the post-commit hook with deterministic file lists.
